// Steps to flesh out functions vvv
// On start, load the game for the first branch, start playing music (make sure the selected audio will loop).
// the dialog box will be changed with every fuction of current branch of the game.
// Change audio depending on startGame, youAreDead, youWin, gameOver.
  // for every story branch function use the removeChoice function ath the bottom, and then update the buttons to lead to the next related branch/story function.
    // choice1Btn.onClick(){load selected function}
// Either add or change background, add or change enemy(if relevant).
  // Depending on branch, animate/run gif of player status(attack, roll, death, etc.)
    // Also animate/run gif of enemy status(on top of background box on the right.)
//At the end, add amount of button clicks or a value of how many choices the player made by using the const totalChoices.
